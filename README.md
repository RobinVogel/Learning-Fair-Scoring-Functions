# Learning-Fair-Scoring-Functions
Contains the code associated to the ArXiV paper: Learning Fair Scoring
Functions: Fairness Definitions, Algorithms and Generalization Bounds for
Bipartite Ranking

The code uses tensorflow (was tested on TF2, but should be compatible with TF1 as well)
and usual python libraries e.g. numpy, matplotlib.

All of the commands necessary to generate the results and the figures are contained 
in `generate_all_figures.sh`. To select the right ROC curves for Figure 11,
one needs to pick the right numbers that encode the parameter values (see 
`params/lambda/lambda_{0..5}.json` and `params/reg/reg_{0..6}.json`)
by looking at the files `table.tex` generated by `generate_all_figures.sh`
and replace them in the file `generate_all_figures.sh`.
Changing the numbers is used to select ROC curves in the set of all
results contained in the folder `results`.

Before starting the experiments, one needs to download the data, that
can be found in [this storage](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14HOZAeUm68riJgcsNybYuwERv_meEcHG)
and copy the `data` folder at the root of the repository.
